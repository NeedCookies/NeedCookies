Hello, Im Emil Kalimullin, backend.Net developer from Kazan. I'm a passionate self-taught developer and sometimes I feel like this one:

But despite of all difficulties I continue work and improve my skills in backend development.

My skills:
1) .Net
   - C# language 
   - ORM (Dapper, EntityFramefork)
   - ASP.Net Core MVC | Asp.Net Core API
2) python
  - syntax
  - request, Selenium, BeautifulSoap, telebot, email and some of other built-in libraries for work with Web sites
3) Algoritms
  I'm currently studying at Tinkoff Course of Algotims and Data Structures where I've learnt such structures like:
    - Stack, Queue, Deque, heap,  Graphs, Binary Trees, Segment Tree, hash-table;
  and also we learnt such algoritms like:
    - binary search (-on answer), prefix sums, quick sort, graph search algorithms (BFS, DFS, Floyd etc.), scanlyne, dynamic programming.
    
(I know all of the above at basic level and have managed to apply it only on my own ped-projects)
